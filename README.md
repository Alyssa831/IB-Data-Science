### IB Data Science Coursework

This coursework is for IB students in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. It uses some of the linear algebra and Fourier analysis concepts covered in IB Paper 7 and Paper 6, respectively. In particular, the relevant material is in Handout 6 of Linear Algebra ("Least squares"), and in Handout 6 of Signal and Data Analysis ("Discrete Fourier Transform"). 

<br>

### Structure

This course involves two self-study, interactive Jupyter notebook 'activities', with exercises at the end of each activity. The activity notebooks cover:

1. Introduction to time series, and using linear regression to model the trend in the time series
1. Using Fourier analysis and linear regression to model the seasonal variation (periodic components) in a time series 

There is a another _optional_ notebook on model selection, which you are strongly encouraged to go through, but is not compulsory.

The notebooks are designed to be completed in order. To complete an activity:

1. Read through a notebook, and change parts of the programs if you want to experiment with what 
   happens - this will help your understanding. 
1. Complete the exercises for the notebook before moving onto the next activity. 

This course is structured similarly to the IA Michaelmas computing course, where you learned the basics of Python programming. As you move through the activities you might need to revise some of the IA notebooks. As in IA, we will be using Python 3.

### Completing exercises

Exercises for each notebook are in the "Exercises" directory. There are *three* exercises to be completed into total

- Use Markdown cells when required to describe what your program is doing.
- Some exercises include automated testing to provide feedback on the correctness of 
  your implementations.    
  
You will have to upload you three completed exercise notebooks in *PDF format*. For submission details, including the deadline, please check the [Moodle site](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=174011)

### Running notebooks

#### Google Colab

[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rv285/IB-Data-Science)

Cambridge students/staff: Please sign intp Google Colab using your `CRSid@cam.ac.uk` . 

#### Running locally

Jupyter can also be run locally. As in IA, the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution is recommended. Be sure to download the Python 3 version.

### Getting help

1. There will be an online Helpdesk during weeks 8 and 9 of Lent Term, and during weeks 0 and 1 of Easter term. For exact dates and times, check the [Moodle site](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=174011).
As mentioned earlier, you are strongly encouraged to get your work marked at a Helpdesk session. 

1. There is a discussion forum on the [Moodle site](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=174011). Please help out by answering questions on the forum. Helping each other is encouraged - if you receive help make sure that you do understand what you have done.  If you need help or have questions, please visit a Helpdesk or post your question on the forum (rather than emailing me directly).
