    "This is the introductory notebook for the IB Data Science coursework at the Department of Engineering at University of Cambridge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course is for IB students, and uses some of the linear algebra and Fourier analysis covered in Paper 7 and Paper 6, respectively. In particular, the relevant material is in Handout 6 of Linear Algebra (\"Least squares\"), and in Handout 5 of Signal and Data Analysis (\"Discrete Fourier Transform\"). This will be covered in lectures by the end of week 6 of Lent term."

    "This course involves two self-study, interactive Jupyter notebook 'activities', with exercises at the end of each activity. The activity notebooks cover:\n",

    "1. Introduction to time series, and using linear regression to model the trend in the time series\n",
    "1. Using Fourier analysis and linear regression to model the seasonal variation (periodic components) in a time series \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third _optional_ notebook on model selection, which you are strongly encouraged to go through, but is not compulsory.\n",

    "The notebooks are designed to be completed in order. To complete an activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read through a notebook, and change parts of the programs if you want to experiment with what \n",
    "   happens - this will help your understanding. \n",
    "1. Complete the exercises for the notebook before moving onto the next activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is structured similarly to the IA Michaelmas computing course, where you learned the basics of Python programming. As you move through the activities you might need to revise some of the IA notebooks. As in IA, we will be using Python 3. "
